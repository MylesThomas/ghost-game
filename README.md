Summary: GHOST is a word game where players take turn adding letters to a word. The first to spell a complete word that is greater than 3 letters loses. When adding a letter to the word, you must ensure that you are spelling the beginning of a valid word. The strategy is to corner your opponent into having no choice but to complete the word and lose the game.
The rules of GHOST:
- GHOST is a two-player word game
- Player 1 starts by entering a letter
- Player 2 adds a letter to the first letter.
- The players continue taking turns adding letters
- Each new letter must continue to spell the beginning of a real word
- If a player adds an invalid letter to the word, this player gets a strike and they must repeat their turn.
- Once a player gets 3 strikes, or completes a valid word longer than 3 letters, that player loses and the other player wins.
